Accessories:
* Arduino Mega Board (AMG)
* LCD display

Included Files:
* postfixeval.cpp
* postfixeval.h
* stack.exercise.8.cpp
* stack.exercise.8.h
* graphing.cpp
* lcd_image.cpp
* lcd_image.h
* Makefile
* README

Usage instructions:
1. Connect the Arduino to the PC using an A-B style USB cable.
2. Ensure that the Arduino is using the proper serial port (/dev/ttyACM0 or -ACM1).
3. In the directory containing the files, use commands "make upload && serial-mon"
to upload the code to the Arduino and view the serial monitor.
4. Use (Ctrl- a + z + e) to start local echo.
5. Follow on-screen instructions.

Notes:
* Thanks to: https://blog.protoneer.co.nz/arduino-float-to-string-that-actually-works/
for the nice find.

* Thanks to : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN7INGFw36A // at 3:10

* Thanks to: https://ee-programming-notepad.blogspot.ca/2016/10/16-bit-color-generator-picker.html
for their color generator

* Thanks to: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL2_aWCzGMAwI3W_JlcBbtYTwiQSsOTa6P
for showing the basics of the stack and evaluation of infix expressions

* Usage of some class code with the parentheses balance checker as a minor project addition

Assumptions:
* That the variable z is used as a placeholder for the independent variable that will be used to graph the
dependent variable y such that y = y(z)
* That the types of brackets used are open ()... this is to remain consistent with common calculators' notation (desmos, texas instruments etc.)
* The the list of functions include only:
>tan, sin, cos, exp, log (natural logarithm), atan, acos, asin, tanh, sinh, and cosh
>also general polynomials can be handled with the exception of those that are limited by the pow functions such as cube roots
* There are only non-sophisticated user input error detection measures in place including:
>parentheses checking, wrong variable checking, and unknown character detection

Issues with the program:
* Issues with log and tan functions such that they cause minor visual glitches
* Issues vertical asymptotes on really large domains (tanx) for large domains) being visible
* Because the dtostrf() requires the programmer to make sure that it has enough storage for the values, there is a restriction
on the number of digits to the double number digits, but the amount of digits it that is hardcoded as of now is 50, which is quite generous
* "...pow cannot be used to obtain a root of a negative number..." from http://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/math/pow
