## Purpose:

An automatic duplex printer is a luxury for most. It is also another luxury to only print one-sided documents most of the time. So I made a little tool to allow for ANY MANUAL duplex print JOB to be completed in only TWO prints!

## Quick step-by-step guide:

1. First, enter the total document page length number.
2. Then press the first copy button and paste the comma-separated list of number into your printer software for printing.
3. Reposition the papers from step 2, then repeat step 2.
