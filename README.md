# Duplex-Printing-Calculator

Motivations:
It is a luxury for many people to have a printer that can automate duplex jobs. It is also another luxury to only print one-sided documents most of the time. So I made a little tool to allow for ANY MANUAL duplex print JOB to be completed in only TWO prints!

Quick step-by-step guide:
1. First enter the total document page length number.
2. Then press the first copy button and paste the comma separated list of number into your printer software for printing.
3. Reposition the papers from step 2, then repeat step 2.
